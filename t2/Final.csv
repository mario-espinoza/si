True ;Bottom line is you cant Ducks are just like people If you want them to do something you have to reward them Would your dad go to work every day if he didnt get paid Your duck is just the same Things that he normally does paddling around in a pond eating bugs etc he does because thats what ducks do Things like tricks that you want him to do require a special incentive It can be treats it can be affection if he likes being picked up and stroked you could do that when he does a trick well but the bottom line is you have to give him some sort of reward

True ;Hopefully you cant Private schools are not mandated and do not follow all public ed regs Children that go to public school get funding because the state regulates the standards and their parents pay taxes Public funds should not be used for schools that make exclusions in their entrance requirementsPrivate schools basically exist to serve speciall interests If you want state funding you should apply for a charter and then be regulated by your state Once a school accepts funding it can no longer keep its discriminatory rules against ANY group It basically loses most of its private ways It still can maintain some but not as many as it did when totally run by private funds If this is not for you then get private businesses to fund you
True ;There are lots of grants available from philanthropic organizations Basically you propose a program or an existing need and estimate its costs and the Rockefeller Foundation or Ford Foundation or Gates Foundation or one of many smaller foundations decides whether or not to fund it From what I understand these grants are handed out based more on merit of the program than financial need that is they determine that your provide an important service in your community and fund you because of that not just because you need more money I attended a prominent prep school for girls with a very large endowment that still won lots of such grants ever year They may have hired a professional grantwriter for the applicationsYou should check out the websites for some of the philanthropic organizations I mention You should also contact whatever educational association you are accredited by such as the NAIS to see if they have recommendations If you are not accredited you will need to become accredited to attract grant moneyGood luck on your search I am a kid from a poor family who got to attend Chatham Hall one of the best girls schools in the country on scholarship and I am quite grateful I believe in public schools but they are so mediocre in many places now that there need to be alternatives particularly alternatives for kids who arent able to afford expensive tutitions
True ;Make sure you have in change or buy a MetroCard transit fare pass from one of the vending machines in the terminals You can get a day MetroCard that lets you take all the NYC subways and buses you want over a day period for Then take either the number or bus which stops at all the terminals to Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights the last stop on both buses Go downstairs and take the E train to th Street and follow the signs to Penn Station

True ;I suggest a taxi if you are not familiar with how the subway worksJust give plenty of time for possible traffic Besides what better way to see the best city in the world
True ;Another bussubway combination is the M bus from the airport which will cross Manhattan along th Street and turn south Best bet is to get off at Broadway and th street Columbia University and take a downtown train to Penn Station If you buy a Metrocard the fare will cover the bus and the transfer to the subway But a single ride card does not contain a transfer If you use that or pay cash on the bus ask the driver for a transfer

True ;why would you go CHEAP on a wedding Isnt it IMPORTANT 
True ;Make Walmart and the Dollar Stores your best friends They really do have some nice thing in them depending on the areas you want to go Some upscale dollar stores I know that sounds crazy but the dollar stores in really good neighborhoods seem to have some beautiful things you can get for your wedding I started collecting for my wedding from there three months ago I made friends with the girl at the register and i told her what I was looking for really and every time a new shipment came in she calls me Its the same with Walmart they sell every thing just look around and you will find some really good stuff that you might use
True ;It really depends on what you are after I have taken part in two different yard weddings One was very nice and still had a very classy feel to it The other ended up with the bride in her pjs doing tequila shots So when you plan it make sure that you have an idea in mind of what you want Outdoor weddings are tough to plan because of the weather but if you live in a temperate climate you may save money by foregoing the tent rental and just setting up tables and chairs outside To make it nicer try to plan a distinct separation between the wedding and the reception area Also rent or buy nicer chairs for the wedding and set them up in a traditional pathway with a center isle Check out rental shops for an archway to get married under Dont waste time and money on things like favors or the unity candle which often go to waste at outdoor weddings Plan your ceremony at a time of day where people dont expect food ie am or pm and have only cake and punch Also use flowers that are in season and if you are doing artificial try to buy them at sales and collect them or if you are using real flowers try Sams Club or a flower wholesaler for large bunches of flowers Tie a few with a ribbon and you have bouquets Best wishes

True ;There are great addvances over the last years in both detecting medical causes as wll as prescribing medications to assist with this dilemma You can work with limited liquids going before bed and awaking the child intermittently during the night to relieve themself but you must enlist a physician first to rule out physical causes for the condition Time generally cures this but it will be a period for wellacquainting yourself with the washing machine until it happens
True ;this can be geneticbut it may also be a bladder problem Seein a doctor might not be a bad ideaexpecially if ur child is 
True ;Have nothing to drink mins prior to bed and pee before you actually go to bed
True ;First u have to be patientSecond dont make him feel guilty about itThird maybe u should consider a urologist u never know maybe something wrongBut most times that goes away
True ;When they are neat puberty a few years before they will stopBuy pull ups and dont worry about it Most kids are or before they stopJust ignore it and dont make the child feel bad about it
True ;Have a doctor check her out to make sure theres nothing wrong that can be fixed Then wait There is a pill to help with that at least they gave one to my son whos or so when necessary We just told him It happens to some kidsdont worry about it
True ;Dont let him her drink anything for hours before bedEventually he she will grow out of this phasePlease try not to punish the child or put shame on him her This can cause a lot of damageGood luck

True ;This is usually genetic Not a whole lot you can do but hope they grow out of itUntil that time there are diapers for this such thing
True ;talk to your childs doctor to rule out a uti and then in the meantime by the goodnite pants you and your child should both view this site
True ;Reduce the amount of fluid intake especially soda pop near bedtime No fluids an hour before bedtime Make sure they drain their bladder just before going to bed Whatever you do dont punish them of give them a hard time about it Some kids dont grow out of it until just before they hit puberty If youve tried all of this it could be a psychological or physical problem and you might want to consult a doctor
True ;I dont think there is any good answer here except maybe just patience and assuring your child that it will eventually passGood luck 
True ;Try taking him to a chiropractor Ive seen it help older kids
True ;put him night panties tell him that its not good to do it for such a big age try your luck
True ;Have him sleep on the floor
True ;Electric blanket
True ;Try not giving water or any drinks within two hours of bedtimeSet an alarm around midnight and wake him to get up and go the bathroom yes a pain but worth it Some children sleep deeply and may not even realize they have the urge Make sure it isnt medical or a problem with his kidneys though Try online seeing products they have out there to alert the child when their pants are wet
True ;Any unestablished writer needs a real job to support himself before getting his writing career off the ground You cannot just submit and rake in the millions More than likely if you were to be picked up the money wouldnt last you very long and youd be living in your parents basement once againTo get noticed its ideal to get your name at least some credit in the world Start by submitting to magazines If your story is posted chances are the editor thought it was good If not you obviously need to look over what youve written and refine your skillsTo become fully published you just start sending to publishers Send and send and send because the chances that youll not get rejected are almost none Even world famous authors have been given negatives answersEducation wise It would be preferred that you have a degree in English the language and literature specifically prose to understand fully symbolism allegories character and plot development et cetera Though you want to write fiction having a background related to what youre writing about would be extremely helpful if just for when you get the time to sit down and write ie To write historical fiction it would be expected youve dabbled in history deep enough that you know more than the average high school education 
True ;Hmm Im not sure It was my understanding that someone would just have to read your work to get it published I have always wanted to do the same but never really looked into it myself Have you had anything posted in magazines Maybe they could help There are some publishing books to look at You pick the category youve written under and send it to the address listed Perhaps you could find a publishers listing book at the library I wish I could help you out more Good luck
True ;its like the world of art they seemingly try to claim that unless you are accepted by the writers board you can write any old rubbish and print it
True ;It depends If you write commericial work you may find it easier to make a buck writing If youre trying to write art literature the road may be much more difficult In all creative fields the important think is practice practice practice So write write write Write everything you can Write articles for magazines write for websites Develop your craft Everyone has to decide how they will feed their art Some painters are construction workers or electricians Some are designers But if you spend hours a day designing websites you dont have much time or energy left over for painting If you write for a newspaper making deadlines you may not have energy for poems
True ;You dont need any education to become a successful writer although if you are thinking about going to college which you should be doing there are alot of majors that could ultimately strengthen your writing skills English Lit Philosophy and Journalism are only a few suggestions but more importantly a college life will enable you access to thousands of people who you could meet and learn fromUsually what the safe thing to do after college is to get a job at a magazine or newspaper to help with the cash flow while you work on your novel but what alot of the great novelists have done is to dive right into their writing without no other job that takes alot of courage but if you believe in yourself then go for itMeanwhile you should really think about sending your poetry and short stories to publishers it wont hurt to try Also I am sure there are alot of websites where you can post your work these are the first steps for gaining recognition 
True ;Write a good controversial book
True ;You could keep an eye out for local or non local competitions that are looking for fresh new talent Keep in mind that you cant become a professional hotshot writer straight away Explore the net there is bound to be something that would help you towards this dream of yours Some websites you could check out are wwwwritingcom wwwwritingworldcomI personally would have another job to start out with extra cash is always good to have Im not sure about having a job while producing written work it may turn out to be stressful if you become a well known writerBasically if your completely unsure of what to do and I havent helped go see a careers counsellor Theyll know what you have to doGood luck
True ;Hey buddy its great to see that other guys are into the craft of writingIts a very intelligent proffession However there are no clear rules for attaining fame or notoriety in the circles of authors or publishersThere doesnt seem to be any rhyme or reason to it Stephen King collected thousands of rejection letters before he wrote Carrie On the other hand some authors plunge into the limelight with their very first submission to a publisherThe best advice I can offer is to write your best Put the love of fame on the back burner and focus on the writing Make sure you are always working on making your writing truly impressive to your readersGood Luck and Ill be looking for you on the shelves of BN

True ;Please take her to a vetbetter safe than sorryYou wouldnt want the poor wee soul to be in pain
True ;When in doubtDO take her to the vet The vet will be able to tell you if it is anything to worry about GL with your cat
True ;Cats teeth are filthy and when they fight they bite each other often causing infection at the wound site and if this is not treated infection can enter the blood stream Your cats leg may or may not be broken but the infection needs to be be treated The swelling you talk of could be infection rather than injury to the muscle or boneI am not a vet but I have owned many cats and learnt this along the way Good luck
True ;when the cat is sleeping touch the area u think might be hurt it wont fake pain while it is asleep
True ;My cat fell out of my window it was a sliding window that was only open maybe about inches and feet off the ground well he fell out the only way I can think of what happened is he tried to get out and since there was no screen on the window his leg must of got caught and he broke his tibula fibula leg I took him to the vet he said it would cost close to to put a cast on him I didnt have the money so the dr suggested bed rest how do you put cat on bed rest you may ask well basically keep him in a kennel for a week So I chalked up for that I brought that cat home and what does he do He runs around like nothing ever happened Im glad he didnt get a cast He was fine after a week of not moving around too much But if youre still in doubt and have the money take her to the vet Good luck
True ;You should act straight away indeed Another way to tell if she is in pain is that cats also purr when are are in pain Odd I know but its true
True ;Take her to the vet ASAP You can try and feel if its broken but I would take her in and get an xray
True ;you should take her to the vetit could just be sprained but you dont want to chance anything
True ;Ur best bet is taking ur kitten to the vet and getting her looked at for a broken leg and also get her tested for aidsleukemia and other diseases that might or could have been transferred to ur kitten IMMEDIATELY
True ;The only real way to know is to get her to a vet asap for xrays and an exam Its better to be safe than sorry sometimes animals can mask pain My cat once had an infection from a catfight and a fever of degrees and I had no idea he was that sick until I got to the vet had I waited any longer he probably wouldnt have made it
True ;an XRay would be called for
True ;Dude take it to the vet she needs it

True ;do circuit weight training for the entire body if you work out with weights say sets of reps on each muscle group and no breakexample if you finished a set of bicep curls dont rest for a minute and then do your next set Instead do your triceps when finished do your biceps again and so onyou are resting one muscle but immediately do another the point is it will keep your heart rate up you are getting your cardio this way and will shed the lbs fastAlso the more muscle you build will burn fat faster at rest

True ;In general the best effort to be made to stop a bill is to write your representative Senator and tell him her that you are against the proposition If he she notices that a large majority of his her constituents is against it then he she will probably vote against it This is of course in a perfect worldIn the real world it is very difficult to really imagine what is happening on the hill More often than not a representative will vote on a particular bill against his her beliefs or desires of the constituents in order to gain a vote from another rep on another bill For instance You and your constituents want a law saying all cars must be red I want them all to be blue You want free ice cream on Thursdays I want free soda pop on ThursdaysSo we make a deal you vote for blue cars and in turn I vote for ice creamAs for the particular bill in question both partisan groups see big personal advantages in passing this bill The Democrats see a LOT of new voters while the Republicans see LOTS of cheap labor for their pals in Big Industry who get them voted into office So I think we Americans are going to see the probably biggest sellout of our society in a long time I have already stated my opinion on this immigration issue in an earlier post so I wont go into it again here except to say this The immigrants showed ZERO respect for our laws by their actions why reward them with citizenship

True ;Contact your Congressmen and contact Reid and Frist who are the primary movers on how the bill would be worked out Note that todays articles only speak of the Senate Bill however After that is passed with any amendments over the next couple of weeks it will need to be negotiated against the House Bill which is the strict one the illegal immigrant supporters marched against The Senate Bill is what they are hoping to have passed by Memorial Day not the actual lawOver the next two weeks you need to get to your Representatives since the march organizers are saying they are showing up at the Senators doors to demand a rolling three year statute of limitations which would not only make these current illegal immigrants legal it would make anyone who came illegally in the future and stayed three years equally eligible for legalizationHowever I think there will be a path to citizenship for qualified current illegals at the end of the day or no law at all It might work if you asked that while the current illegals be given Bushs path to citizenship they not be allowed to bootstrap other family outside of the country in under immigration laws Their other family could apply like any other alien but would not be given special preference I dont know if the Senatorss aids read constituent mail carefully enough to pick up details like that but it is worth a try

True ;Your local library will have some incredible books that answer your questions One example is called Consulting for Dummies It talks about setup start up fees pros and cons and more
True ;many ways but the most reliable way is to ensure that you can identify a need that you have particular expertise in Clients are not quick to pay someone for advice They will talk to you at length as long as it is free but shaking the money loose is hard for a new consultant You must be a bona fide expert in whatever their area of need is It must be an area of need that either costs them real money or offers significant upside Your costs and the amount of effort must be clearly defined so that they can calculate their return on investment It is also many times easier to start with small tangible deliverables and projects that are part of a longerterm roadmap That way they can take a chance on getting started without risking a lot of money But always remember it is the clients money No one likes to waste even of their own money so dont assume that small is an easy sell On the other hand if a client is desperate and sees a big payoff they may be quick to sign over hundreds of thousands of dollars I had a client who beat me down on a proposal and never ended pulling the trigger Then a need came up that had potential multimillion dollar impact and they thought I could save the day They pretty much said whatever it takes and spent about without any competitive bids or hard negotiation Good luck

True ;Try microwaving along with a bowl of water The humidity should keep the cheese moist Might take a few times but its worth a shot
True ;There are a couple of ways of doing this an its more along personal preferenceFirst its easier to make this type of cheese if you start with Velveeta cheeseThat being said melting cheese with out creating that crust on it can be done by cutting the cheese up in cubes which gives more surface area to heat up Then mix in some milk with the cheese to help slow heat it and to make the heat dissipate evenly Cook some then stir then cook some then stirAnother alternative is to turn down the power of the microwave so that you have a slow heat instead of a quick fast heat This kinda defeats the purpose of a microwave but it can make for a thicker melted cheese that you dont have to add as much milk toHope this helps
True ;Use a plastic bag add a bit of milk
True ;As in nachos best way Ive found is to microwave it for a few seconds under the time it takes to melt then let the heat melt it the rest of the way
True ;I sugest adding some milk to it and if you dont want to do that just heat it slowly on a low heat
True ;For one thing you are cooking it on high too long The cheese in a can is a different type too
True ;idk
True ;Do not micowave so long Try beverage on your dial
True ;your cooking it to long put it in a bag for a couple of seconds and keep restarting it every time the buzzer goes off until it is melted as much as you want it
True ;Slowly and on a low setting
True ;well first use velveeta its made for the microwave and melt it with milk in the bowl or cup so it melts creamy and not crusty
True ;just add some milk to it
True ;I put a little water in it Its the only way Ive tried that workedWater makes moister so it keeps it moist

False ;Man are you naive
False ;Leave it to someone that cant spell or compose a decent sentence to stick up for Kerry and bash Bush Typical First of all I guess the best way to determine how someone feels about something is what they say Kerry has called the soldiers he served with torturers and baby killers Dont you find it a little odd that most of the men he served with hate his guts He has accused our brave men serving in Iraq of terrorizing women and children And now he calls them idiots If he indeed has nothing but admiration for our troops he sure has a strange way of showing it As for who is getting sent to Iraq I can assure you that there are far more Republicans serving in Iraq than Dumbacrats All you have to do is look at is who our troops vote for when the Dimocrats allow their votes to be counted

False ;The Republicans are capitalising on statements Kerry made years ago to substantiate an antitroop banner on Kerrys head with a second sound bite If you have listened to the entire speech kerry was obviously BUSH bashing leading up to the statement and did not complete the entire thoughtHowever he did prove his wishywashy ways by apologizing instead of standing firm that he was merely Bush bashing Of course the Republicans are only going to air the questionable sound bite days before the election If I was the party gettign ready to be handed one of the worst losses in American history I would do the same thingThe only sad point is that the only way to get rid of the corrupt and inept Republicans is by electing the weak and ineffective DemocratsSad Sad state of the Union this is

True ;Polaris is always due north duh and at an elevation equal to your latitude So from LA at N latitude Polaris will be above your northern horizon Remember that a compass does not point exactly north in the LA area it points about east of northThe easiest way to locate Polaris is to follow a line through the two stars at the end of the Big Dippers Bowl
True ;Typically you can take the two stars in the end of the big dipper you want the two that make up the side of the scoop away from the handle and you draw an imaginary line straight as if you are coming out of the scoop and it will take you directly to Polaris However Polaris is not a very bright star and you may not be able to see it due to the light pollution in LA I know I cant see it in Phoenix Good luck and enjoy the stars
True ;Theres a good star map at this website wwwkidsastronomycom academy lessonassignmenthtmIf you can find The Big Dipper Ursa Major you can easily spot Polaris The North Star 
True ;The best way Ive found to find any Star or Planet in the night sky is an excellant piece of Astronomy software called STARRY NIGHT wwwstarrynightcomOnce youve set your location on Earth and the time you are will be observing itll show you the night sky in accurate detail once youve established which direction you need to look a compass helps its pretty straight forward from there

True ;referNATIONAL GEOGRAPHY SPECIAL EDITION THE LIVING MAYAN the ultimate discoveryscientists have been collecting dna sampel all around the america continental to prove that the mayan are still aroundafter mitchmatch millions of sample they got their match but glory seem farThey ve the ultimate sample but they dont have the personIt is reported that the person only write sarfalsun in the volunteer form
True ;Why did the Maya disappear is a question that has baffled historians for years Because the Maya disappeared long ago no one will ever know for sure what happened to them Many theories exist but none are definitely true In the PostClassic period the Maya abandoned many of the cities in the south such as Palenque and Tikal and they migrated northward to settle Uxmal Then Uxmal was abandoned and Chitchen Itza was settled and ultimately conquered by the people of Mayapan Mayapan ultimately fell to the Spaniards who tried to convert the people to Christianity and forced many to become slaves Nevertheless the pattern existed that the cities would be settled and ultimately abandoned Some of the theories are that over population may have caused people to move because there was not be enough food for everyone The Maya were a farming people and the farmland would not be fertilized like today The farmland may have not produced as well and caused a famine and thus forced the Mayans to move to more fertile lands Some historians have also said that droughts may have caused the people to movesince they would have to find land with more water to drink and farm with Other people have suggested reasons such as climatic changes earth quakes and sickness or epidemics One other big reason may have been warfare from neighboring cities or invaders from other countries No one will ever know for sure why the Mayans abandoned their cities but we do know that the ruins are in the jungles with the buildings standing And the Mayans may have moved for any number 
True ;There are literally MILLIONS of Mayan people living in Mexico and Central America They didnt die out They just abandoned their cities The lastest theories are that it was due to warfare and extended drought
True ;First YES the Maya people still live in Southeastern Mexico today I work and live with Mayan speaking people regularly Their culture is alive and kicking even if modified significantly by modern and historic development When archaeologists speak of the Maya collapse they are talking mostly about the collapse of Maya cities and states By the s AD most Maya cities their kings and their elite had collapsed Yet this was only one of a number of Maya collapses there were many cities and states in the Maya culture that fell long before the s The main arguments surrounding the collapse of nearly all Maya centers in the s are as followsOver deforestation The Maya agricultural system relied on clearing large stretches of forest Additionally trees were required for making lime for stucco making charcoal and even cooking food After centuries of population growth eventually the forest was nearly goneDrought Pollen cores from lake sediments indicate that there was a widespread drought throughout what we now call Latin America This would have taxed the agricultural system which had already overfarmed and overcut the forest With large populations depleated soils and now a massive drought this may have hastened the fall of Maya capitalsOther ideas that have been put forth such asEndemic Warfare The ancient Maya recorded many events in stone including wars There are increased records of wars and increased evidence of defensive structures ditches walls etc during the centuries in questionTopheavy government This is a weak argument IMHO that states that Kings are not as well suited to deal with the above setbacks as a more democratic or committee based system In other words if the King takes credit for the good times he must take the fall during the bad times Therefore when times turned bad the people turned against the current power structureI must conclude by restating my initial response the Maya culture is alive and well The people in the area where I work still have the same last names as the last Kings of Mayapan They speak the Mayan language and observe the Maya ceremonies that have been documented througout historyI encourage everyone to get OUT of Cancun and visit the rural villages of Yucatan where you will meet the modern Maya one of the most kind generous and helpful cultures I have ever encountered

True ;charge rentmake him do work around the house
True ;Being out of work for anyone is hard Especially when you rely on your family to carry you over the problem times My advice to you is to sit down with him and maybe tell him I see that you have lost your UMPH to go back to work Maybe we could put your resume on some job sites and get you back working Be gentle with him at first year olds push back with pushed Just let him know that you think that he is better than sitting around home Help him with what he wants to do for his future Sometimes we just loose sight of what is important Good Luck

True ;Firstly if he is finished university or college then he really should be out on his own If he didnt even go to school and is still living with you then hes been there years too long What is causing you to keep him there I think that is the question at hand here Your coddling is what is causing him to not work or find a job and I would imagine this has been going on most of his life This lack of expectations of him may be causing confusion and hence his depression and low self esteem Your job is to lift your child up not stifle him You might as well being saying I dont believe in your talents and skillsI dont believe in being harsh with your child so maybe he needs counselling As well you need to sit down with him to develop a plan with goals otherwise he will spend the rest of his life shirking responsibilityLets say he finds a job within the next monthsThen is out on his own within the next months Hes an adult now treat him like one
True ;He needs to be kicked out or told to pay rent or something along the lines Hes he should have a job by nowyou are only enabling him if you let him live there rent free He needs to get off his bum and support himself and you are doing him more harm then good by supporting him
True ;true You may wanna get him counseling He may not be feeling motivated due to being depressed which is pretty common but better to get help sooner than later
True ;if he is living with you give him a time limit you know if he had to support himself he would have to find a job kick his lazy butt out if he wont he hangs because u allow it
True ;Do it in steps Reassure him he will find something and see if he is depressed or just being lazy Help him find something that will interest him Once you find something or he has seriously started looking again hold him to making some progress in days If he fails to make progress the best thing you can do is to encourage him to live on his own kick him out and it may help to figure it out Starving is the motivation for success

True ;Thats too muchyour body needs time to rest and recover
True ;try for only days of workouts i dont know what your weight train sessions are like but if you want to just maintain lean muscle mass then you should be doing low weight high reps with little rest periods tempting to rest until your muscles are all recovered but try not to do this this wont cause muscle tissue to tear and regrow since its not putting enough pressure on your muscle tissues to tear what this does is to basically turn your weight train session into a cardio session so you end up maintaining muscle and burning calories and fat by keeping your heart rate elevated if you actually want to build muscle then you need to lift heavy enough to tear your muscle tissueotherwise you should be good min cardio is best if you want to target fat burn and youre doing an hour

True ;First the dog has to be on a full AKC registration Also has not been spayed neutered Then go to wwwakcorg find an event you want to go to Bathe Brush the dog thouroughly when in the show ring follow the judges instructions Itll take LOTS of practice time Money youll have to learn to groom your breed to its approppriate standard learn to handle the dog in the ring Also do NOT take a b i t c h in season be SURE your dog is well behavedAlso Show doopgs are not bred fopr profit it actually costs a small fortune to finsh a dog to its championship the costs involved in producing a quality litter are often not even repaid by selling the pups just some food for thoughtGood luck
True ;show it what
True ;just a suggestion to think about buying a show dog and or breeding show dogs is a terrible practice or sport so many unwanted animals die in a pound every day because people buy or breed dogs for show these animals in the pound are just as great as a purebred just think about saving lives sometime and not contributing to people who breed animals for profit most of the time they are raised in horrible conditions as well if you choose to not listen to me so be it just something to think about thank you for reading
True ;Call your local H dog club they will be able to help you get started at the local level Also attend any AKCUKC clubs and shows and talk to other show dog handlers for tips and training
True ;You have to have lots of money it is an expensive sport You must start with a puppy from a breeder who is already showing and is controlling the breeding of their kennel Those pups usually go for several thousand dollars also Go visit your local dog club and attend several dog shows before you make this commitment You can watch the dog shows on Animal Planet also but those dogs have been doing it for awhile
True ;Dissect it
True ;Eat protein and gelatin so your hair will grow in strong You can buy gelatin capsules if you dont want to eat a lot of Jello You should also take a Vitamin E capsule daily and cook with canola oil for shiny hair You should use a deep conditioner on your hair once a week You can pick one up at a drug or beauty supply store You can also try using coconut oil on your hair once a week Massage it into your scalp and pull it through your hair Shampoo it out in the morning Coconut oil adds moisture and shine and helps repair damaged hair You can find it in a natural health food store or online at places like wwwdrugstorecom You can use olive oil or shea butter if you prefer

False ;If it only has one eye it is a oneeyed cat regardless of which direction the eye is pointing

True ;DudeIve heard so many sure fire ways to remove ink over the yearsand frigging none of them work THe only thing I had any success with was actually using hair spray this only works if you catch the stain immediately and rubbing alcohol afterwards Pretty much get used to the idea of the shirt being done
True ;on what if on shirt or sum try puting hair spray but hurry dont let it dry then wash it wit the hair spary it will come right off 
True ;Aqua Net hairspray on the spot before laundering it
True ;you should use alcohol and then put it in the rinse cycle
True ;dye the whole shirt blue
True ;rubbing alcohol
True ;Try this There is a new class of cleaners out there like simple green but better I use Oil Eater from costco Lowes has something similar They are all biodegradable nontoxic and say degreaser Whew Use full strength rub with a brush I have removed impossible stains Alcohol added might help I have used both together
True ;This website has lots of information on removing ink stains wwwdiynotcom pages st stphp
True ;soak the stain in a saucer of milk if the stain still shows soak in a solution of bleach and water
True ;My mum told me to soak the stain in milk for a few minutes or longer if necessary Place the stained part in a bowl of milk
True ;I just spent months there Just use extreme common sense Dont walk around with your wallet in your pocket I used to put different amounts in each pocket just in case But nothing ever happened Dont take the MRT or any tricycles Dont be flashy and obnoxious There are just millions of people and a lot of desperate people However there are tons of great people that will look out for your best intrest as well Listen to them do not be a superhero Things can be shakey there but its okay to walk around by yourself in the nicer areas Sign up for the online travel warnings and listen to them But again youd be just fine Im female and went to work there Its weird having everyone stare at you at first but you get used to it The only things that happened were some guy got caught on the MRT their monorail system with dynamite and then the city was a bit unrest during some political stuff But basically they have their heads on straighter than us cocky Americans The day I came home I saw so much on the news about murders rapes robberies here that I really felt safer in Manila People are more trustworthy thereBuy a prepaid cell phone when you get there so your parents can call when they want to Enjoy if you get to go Definitely get out of the city if you can
True ;IMO all country have criminals and what so ever you may think off all i can say is if you are coming here just be careful i mean basic instinct on what your mom tells you when you were a little kid
True ;You need to read the State Department warnings Criminals are everywhere It is rare to travel through the Islands without being robbed or scammed or worse Most crime goes unreported and the Filipinos will not admit how dangerous it is in the Philippines Your parents are really acting in your best interest Listen to them on this one
True ;When you go to Phils you should take a lot of precautionary measures specially in Manila Ilocos region is a little bit safer but still when youre a foreighner people think that you have a lot of money and they have the tendency to charge you a much higher cost on everything I live in Manila and when you are here you should always take a look at your back specially on the downtown areas a lot of pickpockets snatchers holduppers and taxi drivers you charge you triple the regular price
True ;Once you travel maybe it is safe then again its safe then again so dont get too much confident about traveling it is not only in the Philippines but anywhere in the world has a chance of getting involved into accident disasters or crimeLet me give you examplelike in Thailand when the tsunami happened how many tourists were affected Your parents are only trying to protect you and people here are giving different opinions If you have family or friends in the Philippines you could ask them to be your guarantor that you would be safe because they are with you during your travel Precautions Stay away being late outside and have someone with you everytime
True ;I will go with Corpredshe is absolutely rightI have been to philippines also
True ;have you been here in the phlippines before and if your sure enough and brave enough to travel on your own and why not you also have your own life to enjoy but always be careful and be alert dont be fool to the people you meet and dont know but you said you have family here well thats the good one tell them to accompany you and convince your mom that you will be really safe by them there are really great places here in phlippines goodluck to you

True ;Everyone makes mistakesTell your mom that the girl you like isnt the only one who has made a bad choiceTell your mom that nobody is perfect including your mom I kinda agree with your mom though tooShe is only trying to protect youShe doesnt want you to get in with the wrong peopleDrinking is dangerousthe only reason your mom grounded you and said you werent allowed to talk to the girl is because she cares about yousome moms wouldnt do anythingShe only wants whats best for youi think you should try to get to know the girl better before you say you love heri wouldnt sneak around and talk to her because you are going against your mom and you will get in even more trouble
True ;As a daughter Unfortunately there is probably no way of convincing her I am My mom will never be happy with who I date No one will ever be good enough and I just worry I dont want you to get hurt are the most common statements out of my mothers mouth Im an adult I am engaged to the best man ever ask around Its not going to change As a mother I would be pissed at my daughter shes currently if she was hanging out with people drinking at Your girlfriends mother should be trying to keep her away from the same crowd as well to keep her out of trouble People do make bad decisions and that doesnt make them bad people However how well do you really know her Is she worth all this At its hard to know Do the best you can for now and youll be an adult soon If shes that great youll find a way If not youll find someone better Either way try to stay out of trouble This probably isnt very helpful but hopefully you can see it from another point of view
True ;WOW WELL IVE BEEN IN THAT SITUATIONEXCEPT I WAS DATING A WHITE GIRL AND WE SKIPPED SCHOOL TOGETHER AND HER DAD CAME HOMELUCKILY WE WERENT DOING ANYTHING AND MY MOM FORBID ME TO SEE HERHONESTLY ITS JUS GONNA TAKE TIME SHE WILL COME AROUNDIT WILL COME DOWN TO HER MEETING YOUR MOM IN THE FUTUREBUT IN THE MEANTIME MAKE SURE UR MOM DOESNT KNO YALL SPEAK ANYMORE CUZ THAT JUS ELONGATES THE PROBLEM LET HER CALM DOWNOH AND ONE MORE THINGDONT UNDERAGE DRINK
True ;dont tell ur mom talk to her secretly and wen ur old enough do wat u want
True ;oki can tell that you are in the teen years if i was your mom im sorry but id ground you too there is no reason for you to be out drinking and driving riding in cars with other kids that are drinking riding in cars do you know how dangerous that is i am i have been ALLLLL through highschool and college your mom has lost trust in you and since she doesnt have any other characteristic to go on for your lady friend she now deems her unresponsible and immature as well moms are like that they are very big on the first impression since you left her in the dark about this lady she now only knows her as a girl that thinks drinking alcohol is a good hobby no mom is going to just dismiss that i had an overbearing mom but a lot of the things she did actually make sense in hindsight you should spend more time walking the straight and narrow dude you have to earn her trust back
True ;I feel for you but the circumstances surrounding all of this doesnt set it all up in a good light I know when you are you think youre Mom is being a Nazi and she is too overprotective and all of it However were not just talking about things like not doing your schoolwork here ya know Youre saying that you all were drinking and thankfully you only had one but that is against the law right there I dont know what state you live in but in most states it is either or years of age that you are allowed to drink Why arent you realizing what happened here What went wrong Is it really your Moms fault I know you want to just put it all on her but she is watching out for you at a time when she is knowing that you are not an adult yet though I know I know you are dying to be I dont know your Mom I can only speak as a Mom here and I wouldnt be impressed to start with with somebody who has been drinking etc and then wanting to date you However I would give you a certain punishment and if you stick with it and follow the punishment grounding then you need to be given a chance to learn from your mistakes and hopefully the girl you like does too and you can move forward Just know though that you also need to be putting your energy into your schoolwork what do you want to do with your life What hobbies or interests besides girls do you have You know there is a bigger world out there and we Moms are just trying to help you all prepare for it So good luck to you Maybe after you are grounded time has gone by you will be able to see her or talk to her more and bring her around the house let your Mom see what a good person she is and how she cares about you etc Hope it helps 
True ;You can start by using cellophane scotch tape to try to lift the pollen off your top Just press the tape into the stain and lift it back off If your top is silk or another delicate fabric you should test a hidden area to make sure it doesnt hurt the fabricAfter getting all the pollen you can with the tape you can try a stain remover intended for the type of fabric youre trying to clean and then wash your top according to the manufacturers instructions

True ;What a coincidence I just did it a few minutes ago Have your latest bill and your checking account number available and go to wwwpgecom Its actually very easy
True ;I had a similar situation when I was a nanny The youngest child refused to go to bed unless her mom was in there with her Of course it meant she did not fall asleep until very late When the parents went out of town I told her she was a big girl and old enough to go to sleep on her own The first night I sat in the middle of her floor with my back to her until she fell asleep each night I moved further out the door and was able to get her to go to bed with out a fuss The key is to stick to your guns on this and since your children are a little older I would talk to them and tell them it is time for them to sleep in there own beds and ensure them that you are close by Again the most important thing is to be firm tell them that mommy sleeps in her bed and they sleep in their beds While it may sound harsh crying does not hurt children it is when they learn that crying gets them what they want it sets a precedence for other areas
True ;Have a night time ritual baths read to them hugs and kisses tuck them in and leave the room Tell them as soon as the sun is up they may come in to wake you up and snuggle with you but only if theyve slept in their bed all night
True ;Theyre probably scared to go to sleep Watching too much TV Maybe they pick up the theory of the boogeyman Tuck them in every night and maybe stay with them a few couple more minutes Make them feel comfortable and then eventually they will go to bed by themselves
True ;Super Nanny sucessfully helped parents with this on her show I think I remember that the parents had to make the childrens room or bed a fun place also be firm bedtime is in their own bed If they come to your room return them to bed If they cry or scream only go in occasionally to reassure them but tell them they must sleep in their own bed It seemed like hell for a week or so then the kids were fine slept in their own beds Kids do need bounderies Hopefully you can be successful at parenting before they are teenagers and you lose all control Hope you do better than I
True ;You need to be consistant They need to sleep in their beds No matter how many times they get up and move themselves you need to put them right back in their beds even if it is the fourth time and its amExplain to them that theyre more than old enough to sleep in their own beds and that youre old enough to sleep alone in yours Make sure they eat dinner atleast hours before bed avoid drinking anything past that point Keep them busy throughout the day and avoid naps also avoid sugarSet a routine every night home work dinner clean up wash up get ready for bed and read a book Dont watch tv right before bed it can be hard to shut off the imagination so quicklyGet them into their beds read them a story and then leave them to fall asleep Theyre more than old enough to fall asleep on their own When they get up explain to them that theyre not allowed to its night time its time for sleeping in their beds and put them back in their beds It doesnt matter how much crying or yelling or insisting there is Youre the parent youre the adult youre in charge Youre not going anything wrong or unhealthy Theyre far too old to sleep with their parents You must be consistant eventually their fatigue will get the best of them and they will give up and sleep in their own bed But until then youre going to have to be the grown up and keep calm and keep with the plan They get up and out of bed you put them back down it may mean losing a few nights sleep but its worth it dont give in every time you do youre sending mixed signals to them and thats not fair If they get up and run around the block you need to be right behind them and end it with them back in their bed Once they figure out that you mean business and that you mean it every time they press you on the issue then they will accept that this is normal and whats expected of them
True ;Ivr had the same problem with my hubbys kids Their mom lets them keep the tv on all night in their room They finally quit climbing in our bed last winter but would sneak down to the living room or crawl into bed with each other Last summer I told them if they didnt sleep in their own bed all night then they couldnt go swimming the next day or took something else away That pretty much worked with the yr old I had to get down right mean with the yr old She would go through the whole house screaming in the middle of the night I told her if she does it again Im going to whip her little butt It was mean and I felt bad but she hasnt done it since I just got tired of her waking all of the other kids up we have between the of us Good luck
True ;The easiest way is to let them outgrow it If you arent happy though you could try any of the followingMake them a place to sleep in your room a sleeping bag on the floor next to your bed may work well Put an extra bed or two next to your bed to create a larger sleeping space Theyll still have the space to sleep with you but they wont be in your way as muchPut them in bed together so that they arent aloneBefore you make any change be sure that you are picking a time that is relatively low stress for the family Kids will pick up on the stress level and adding one stress to another is not going to make for successful learningPlease do not just let them scream or get really upset You may get them to sleep alone maybe not but you will be teaching them that you do not take their feelings seriously It will not enhance your relationship with your children
True ;You need to get this corrected for children aged and are too old to be acting like this There must be some actions like watching too much TV and wrong things on TV and going to bed later than they should Join them in their nightime prayers comfort and praise them assuring them you will see them in the morning
True ;you need to tell them to sleep in their beds or get an walk takie for them so that they can call you when they want you or keep the you bedroom door locked so they cannot come in I know this will be hard but in a few days it will be okay the other is to try and get a teddy bear to hug and sleep and ask them to pretend that mummy
True ;I am also facing the same problem
True ;I agree with the lady above my post snowy It will be hard however they have learned to get what they want and to prolong bedtime by crying They have you compromising with them I would tell them from this day on they sleep in their beds and you in yours When they come into your bed in the middle of the night walk them back to their bed until they get settled and then leave for your room No laying with them letting them sleep on your lounge etc I am not for the crying out theory with kids or babies however any change other than what they want will produce crying so you will just have to hang in there As long as their needs are met not wantsNEEDS and they are safe then you will have to feel confident that what your doing is for theirs and your best interestI would tell them that you will check on them every mins at first then increase to and so on Weather they are fussing or not I would let them see you checking on them and then leave No talking cuddling conversation etcBedtime should be boring so that it signals a need for rest and settling down Good Luck i have been there and still go through it I will warn you that from my experience they will try now and again to get you back into the old routine so you need to always be consistent It will be a slow in your bed which then does over time increase to right where you left off
True ;im going through the same with my and year old but heres what i do i let them sleep in the living room on the couch watching cartoons or disney when they go to sleep i turn the tv off and make sure they have covers over them and let them sleep i let my kids stay up till or any early there up on and off through the night and if they do come and crawl in my bed i pick them up and tell them mommy loves you but theres just no room for you in mommys bed and i carry them back to the couch and turn the tv back on but normally when they stay up to or they sleep all night just dont let them take naps it makes them harder to sleep through the night also with my year old she has to have a teddy bear and a night light on before she will lay down to watch tv this week end were trying to put a tv in the kids room and get them in there own room one step at a time they been sleeping in the living room for to months but if it works them on the couch is better than them in your bed also you can try laying blankets on the floor by your bed so if they come in your room they lay on the floor instead of your bed letting them watch tv there is very little crying and no screaming
True ;get bigger bed i love to sleep with my kidswhat problem
True ;I would take a twofold approach First since they are older children you need to sit down with them and explain the need for personal space separate beds and bedrooms etcNext be sure to SET the NEW RULEthe rule that says when it is bedtimeEVERYONE returns to their own beds Make sure the children understand the rule and have an actual agreementsign a piece of paper shake hands etc so that everyone UNDERTANDS and AGREESEncourgage cuddling reading together in your bed etc BEFORE the actual bedtimeIn fact you could have a designated sleep together nightmaybe once a weekwhen the children are allowed and encouraged to sleep with you all night That is just ONE NIGHT a week Then they do not totally feel rejected etcIf the night is not the special sleep together night however precisely at bedtime state the rule in a calm manner Remind them of the UNDERSTANDING and AGREEMENTOhthey WILL still want to forget the rule agreement etc But they are certainly old enough to realize that they must follow the ruleAfter a couple of rough nights and no matter how rough it gets do NOT allow them back in your roomcan your door lock they will get it and understand that you mean businessDo you have other problems with rule making and then breaking your own rules Do you enforce other household rules or do you cave in and allow the children to have leaway and liberties with other rules Maybe you should revise your ENTIRE household parent rules so that you are CONSISTENT in your discipline
True ; kick them outi think i would take them to the department store and let them pick out their own bed in a bag set and tell them that they have to use itmake it a new rule that has to be followedor you could just take up residence in their beds and see how they feel about that
True ;I tried using what we called the sleep fairy Every night they went to bed on time and stayed in bed the sleep fairy would leave a present under their pillow It was never anything big just a coin or a little novelty toy We did this for a week then explained that since they were doing such a good job it was time for the sleep fairy to move on to the next child She would check in but no longer leave notes and gifts It seemed to work well for my boys
True ;lock your door
True ;This happened n house of tiny tearaways this TV show about toddlers that misbehave or have sleeping eating problems The parents were advised to star out sitting by the children in their room while they start to fall asleep reading them a story and then slowly start to sleep in their own bed If the child got out of bed the parents returned them to it and eventually The child stops doing it and sleeps in his own bed To do this thee is a Lt of emotion all stress that the parents and their children go through the child will most probably cry and cry and cry and the parents usually end up with major headaches but in the end the parents were only going through the trauma for their childs benefit and to have the bed to themselves 
True ;you should make them sleep in your bed till they are fast asleepwhen they are fast asleep you can have sex with your husband and enjoy sucking
True ;When my children are young we are expecting our th we let them go to be with books and a rechargeable flashlight They have fun reading or looking at pictures and seem to fall asleep around the same time as the light would run out It teaches them that they can fall asleep on their own
True ; and yr olds a very capable of sleeping on their own What you need to do is trying setting limits Make sure there bed time in consistent Then talk with them and tell them from now on you are sleeping in their own beds Set a routine some thing like brush their teeth wash hands and face and anything else that you wish A drink of water But try to keep it the same Then put them to bed in their beds and simply state it is bed time and you are to stay in your beds tonight Yes they will probably cry and have all the excuses in the world to get out of bed but only for a night or two as long as when they get up and come to your room you bring them back to their room You cant cave in and let them come to your room it is important that you are firm but loving

True ;Prune Before SpringFirst I cant emphasize enough that the best time to prune is before warm weather sets in Pruning is really a process of directing growth that is energy in the ways you want it to go So its important to get it done in the winter when all the trees energy is still stored in the roots and the stems waiting to be set loose by the coming of spring This also ensures that your tree gets a healthy head start The pruning cuts you make will have a chance to begin healing before the arrival of the bugs and disease common in warm weather A good pruning cut starts at the collar of the branch Height LimitationsWhen working with fruit trees you should remember to think of yourself You dont want to have to haul out a foot ladder to pick your lemons So I recommend pruning your tree to a height of about feet This will also enable the use of a homeownergrade rather than commercialgrade equipment for any spraying you may need to do Layered Horizontal BranchesWithin your feet of fruit tree you should prune with an eye for nice layered branches Remember its the horizontal branches that bear fruit not the upright wood Thus effective fruit pruning will often entail some fairly dramatic cuts especially to some of the larger vertical growth Work inward creating three horizontal layers of branches bottom middle and top each separated by about to inches Also each layer needs only about three or four branches especially the lower layers since more branches will tend to stunt the growth above them And a final bit of common sense Prune so that the tree is wider at the bottom layer than the top which will prevent the top from shading out the bottom The cuts should be made at an angle to help it shed water then painted for protection A Good CutA really good pruning cut starts at the collar of the branch Cut out from there at a slight angle so it can shed water After three or four days your final step will be to paint the pruning cuts to protect the exposed wood from fungus and insects The delay in painting will give the cambium layer the layer of living cells between the wood and the bark time to heal adding protection Follow these simple steps for proper pruning and youll enjoy both the beauty and bounty of your fruit tree for many years to come

True ;Psychologist Barbara Kirwin once noted that you should not pay attention just to the manifestation of your childs interest in vampires but to the ground from which it the interest rises What kind of Vampires does she like benevolent or hateful or powerful She is as you stated and she doesnt have a lot of pull in the world Solution she coopted is that the right word something powerful and widely recognized to feel bigger than she is Shes saying Look at me Im strong and young and in control And by the way many goths do not have an interest in vampires and many vampire freaks do not have any attraction to goth but a sizable amount do enough to cause people to believe that they are one and the same enough to cause some antagonism between the two groups She is most likely aware that in acting like this she is shutting herself off from the mainstream But ask yourself is mainstream society entertainment behavior and culture a good place for a young person nowadays Also to be noted is an issue of cutting Not many people in the goth scene cut for persons into vampire culture the act is almost always between consensual adults Cutting is not recognized as a healthy behavior at any agebut a yearold could wind up hurting herself seriously as she is less likely to be careful or have knowledge of her body knowing where certain arteries are or which places will scar easily I am not trying to make you panic or suggest that your niece is into cutting The issue for her may reflect pun her age many people become fascinated with vampire lore and leave it as they get older and some people tone it down considerably but retain an interest for the rest of their lives Of course it may be an aesthetic issue but there could be some underlying problems leading her this way Or not Love her and keep an eye on her

True ;Wicca isnt fake its a federally recognized religion I dont know what that has to do with being Goth I havent met any Goth Wiccans As for the Vampire thing at she is striving for her own place in life She wants to find her identity The more you disapprove the more she will go that way The best thing to do is be a positive influence Reguardless if she is OCD and ADHD which are very common disorders and shouldnt be made a spectacle of I ought to know I am ADHD and my best friend is OCD I think the only reason you want her to not like Gothism and Vampires is because you are afraid she will eventually leave the church YOu cant force people to believe in your religion If she leaves so be it she is her own personI think the best thing for you to do is research what she is interested in so that you are sure she isnt getting into drugs Also make sure that her and her Goth friends feel welcome because otherwise they will go off and party and that is not what you want Id be more worried about her getting into drugs and sex at that age that a fascination with Vampires Lastly dont call my religion fake I wouldnt do that to you

True ;I wouldnt try to do that If you do you will push the child farther into it You cant just ignore it because then your child will feel like they arent important to you would try to find a few good books on the subject so at least maybe you both can reach a common ground or that you have shown enough interest that you took the time to research it

True ;hiusually to teach a younger one between months not to pee or poo inhouse you simply move his head towards its excrements so that his mouth and nose touches it not roughly but with decision and say some loud word but always the same each time like no bad boy girl anyway with an angry and negative soundbut your dog needs more attention hours are too much physiologically your dog need to get out quite often although shortly but at least once a day for hours can you immagine to stay hours withou tpeeing while you drink all the time psychologically he needs company its frustrating staying h every day alone how do YOU spend hours alone when was the last time you did it well immagine that one hour to your labrador are about hours for humans ie when he she is alone for h his biological clock gives him the sensation of over h alone ie again when he she is alone for years it is like for you spending hours alone sad and as he has no book tv or job as us or similar he uses what he has the kennelsolution spend more time with him her before leaving him alone for hours spend a looong walk with him ie the big outwalk of over h and play with him run he will come back home tired but satisfied happy andempty he will therefore also sleep more easily buy him some stupid toy snack like the fake leatherbone and when you come back home show that you are happy to see him her again and bring him something going out immediately for a short walk for your walks try to organize them on a regular term so he she got used toon the other hand try to understand when he she gives signs he she wants to get out nervous walking crying sounds sniffing at the door in the evening stay closer to him her and more touchy dogs need contactwell he she is getting frustrated and needs more dedication so its your turnciaops if it still persists after you got the right routine he might have some desease thus go to the doc
True ;Try putting his food and water in the area he is urinating If that doesnt help that he may have some sort of urinary infection He may be chewing to try and get out to go pee Take him to the vet to rule out a medical problem
True ;The chewing is probably something he is doing because he is lonely and perhaps angry about being left alone Maybe put something else in there to play with Something to keep him busy during the hours that you are goneThe peeing in the cage Id consult my vet if I were you You never know
True ;Take him to the vet along with a urine sample for a checkup If the health is good then you are looking at some stress and anxiety issues A dog behavior specialist can give you some good ways to go about helping him settle down again
True ;if and when you catch him in the act or right after the act of peeing push his nose in the pee in say clear and firm bad dog
True ;Generally a dog will chew its leg off before it pees in its own kennel Sounds like he may have some discomfort and pain which could be the reason hes suddenly destroying chewing his kennel liner Separation problems generally do not result in a grown dog peeing in his own cave But if you are convinced this IS the problem call home and talk to him on the answerphone a few times a day have a neighbor come by and take him for a walk generally older retired neighbors seem to enjoy this type of helping mind you weve always worked our way into paying them once it was established they really enjoyed our dog One neighbor who checked on our dog for us around noonended up springing him for the entire afternoon would take him across the street to sit at her feet while she played with her baby and watched TV he was good company If your dog does not have a urinary problem going on let the vet check on him be sure to cut back on his water at some well timed point during the day and to take him out two to three times before you leave for work in the morning It would be great if you had a fenced back yard and a pet doorgood luck
True ;He his marking his territory the kennel
True ;He probably has a UTI take him to the vet Dogs dont do stuff like that for no reason
True ;How big is the kennel Dogs normally never pee where they sleep so if you keep him in a small place like a crate he may not pee If he didnt pee in his kennel before it may be due to a medical problem
True ;No problems for months until now Might want to consider taking him to vet to make sure there is no physical issues with him Could just be a fluke Post again in a few days if it continues
True ;my guess would be that he is marking his territory but you may need to take him to a vet to be sure that it is not an infectionalso you may need to find someone who can doggy sit for you while you are at work so that he is not left alone or just find a friend that could come and take him for a walk while you are at work so that he is not in his kennel for the whole day while you are work I know finding someone can be difficult but I am a dog sitter walker and i do offer my clients the choice between doggy sitting for the day night or for walks and companionship during the dayGood Luck
True ;Could be that he is trying to get attention if he is lonely Also could be a bladder kidney infection Id recommend a trip to the vet to rule out any medical causes At least then you know it is behavioral

True ;show that to him if your talking about when he is around his friends or your friends he just might feel uncomfortable acting like your lover and would rather show that you two can get along very well together if your talking about when your alone you might want to show him how you feel however you think that should be done
True ;Its best for your bf to be your friend first then your lover Go out with him for a while more and then the true romance will follow
True ;Okay is he your boyfriend or your lover there is a difference maybe he doesnt consider you his girlfriend maybe you are just someone he has available for when he wants sex If he doesnt acknowledge you around his friends as a girlfriend maybe he doesnt want to have one take a closer look again when you are around him and others
True ;Its better if you act like buddies It will bring you more closer and deeper Then try to kiss and hold handsetc Make dates were you two are the only ones But dont go too deep Cause you two might end up you know
True ;He may be not for you because he do not have that male interest in being your lover The fact that you feel attracted to him does not change him I think you have to set your priorities and expectations higher and look for someone else if you want a lover because you already have a buddy in him
True ;one way you can find a good artist is word of mouth from people you trust and people who have art from the artist of course it may also depend on the type of tat you are wanting since some tat artists are better at certain styles of art such as portraits or fantasy also gettin a tat is kinda like gettin your hair cut it may depend on the artist mood health and state of mind as to how good or bad a job he does for you i strongly suggest gettin to know the artist before gettin work done like go hang with him when hes not busy the results will be better in my opinion if you have time to do this
True ;Usually by recommendation within your social circle
True ;My first consideration would be how sanitary the parlor is Second can the tattoo artist give me what I want as a tattoo and if not is he or she able to create or recommend someone or something I would like
True ;how busy is the place how many artists If more than one look to the one with the best tats and ask who did his no really Also check out the artists portfolio and the artwork on the walls if they cant paint run dont walk out
True ;Ask your friends see what they think and then maybe go to some tatoo parlours and talk to them about what they can offer
True ;Well you have to know if the equipments theyll use on you is clean and safe and maybe you should also see a doctor
