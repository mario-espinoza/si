How did Jesus treat Satan...

To elaborate, and this is only my thought and not in the bible:

Jesus died for our sins. He took them from us so that we might be saved.
Now if He had every sin ever done and would be done, then that is a heavy burden. A sinner like that would go to hell. And He did with our sin. That's right you and I sent Jesus to hell. But that is what he wanted, and how else would he get in if we didn't send Him there. He couldn't just walk right in, so it was staged that way, sort of a covert operation. Then once He was there, he took the keys to life and death and then escaped back to heaven. All this took three days. That way Jesus decides who will live forever and who will die in hell."

"302782","64297","True","1","1","0","Society & Culture","Religion & Spirituality","Religion & Spirituality","How did Satan treat Jesus those three days Jesus went to hell?","","Satan did not treat Jesus in any fashion whatsoever since Satan was not in Hell with Jesus.  

At Acts 2:25-35,  Peter's speech plainly states that Christ went to what the original Greek calls Hades.  Peter is quoting Psalms 16:10 and he makes clear that it prophetically applies to Jesus.  Some Bible translations read hell, others read Hades.  But since Peter uses the Greek word when citing to Psalm, it is obvious that Sheol and Hades (or Hell) are the same thing.  The scriptures also make it plain that Christ died.  He was dead.  And since Ecclesiastes 9:4-5, and 10 make it plain that there is absolutely no consciousness in death, when Jesus went to Sheol, or Hell, or Hades, he felt nothing, knew nothing and did nothing.  Death is not the opposite of life, death is the absence of it.  Moreover, since the scriptures do not say anything about Satan dying, then Satan was not in hell with Jesus.  The Bible Hell, Sheol and Hades are all the same thing:  it is the common grave of mankind where there is absolutely no consciousness.  In order to get out of hell you have to have a resurrection."

"394889","78749","True","1","0","1","Business & Finance","Personal Finance","Personal Finance","how do you invest cd ira's that were inherited from sibling to avoid excessive taxes?","","I'm going to restate the question to be sure that the answer is based on the correct set of circumstances: Your sibling who owned an IRA passed away and left you as beneficiary. If the sibling was under 70.5 years old and you under 70.5 years old as the beneficiary have taken constructive receipt of the funds, you must pay taxes at your ordinary income rate on all of the money ... if you have not taken constructive receipt of the funds you can roll the IRA over to another IRA that would be titled as an Inherited IRA. This means that you will be required to withdraw a certain dollar amount every year from this Inherited IRA based on your life expectancy. That means that the dollar amount you will be taxed on will be based on the dollar amount that is withdrawn. No matter what happens, you will eventually have to pay taxes on all of the money left to you. 

DO NOT listen to the other answer instructing you to put the money into a mutual fund, nobody can accurately know that mutual funds will perform better in the next 25 years than they have in the past 25, nor did they tell you which asset class or money manager to use. PLEASE go see a financial advisor and work with them on an asset allocation strategy based on your investment timeline, age, goals, and risk tolerance."

It tastes .... it definitely tastes like fermented food, with that sort of vinegary bite you'll find in sharp cheese or yoghurt or sauerkraut, but I wouldnt' say it is reminiscent of blue cheese.

I'm sorry to say that I dont' know how to make it, but I'm not that sorry, because it's pretty gross.  It's not the taste of natto that is so unpleasant, but the texture.

When made properly, natto looks not fermented, but rotten. The beans are still in their recognizeable form, but very slimy, and in between every bean as you move or lift them are long, spiderweb-like strings.  These mysterious tendrils are the grossest part of natto.  It definitely looks like a bug colony.

That being said, it's very good for you. It's said in Japan that eating it helps to prevent or cure yeast infections.

Again, sorry I can't help you, but I will let you know that if the whole thing looks shiny and slimy, and you have wispy hairs of rottenness drifting in between every bean -- hey, you've got it right!  :)"

"773932","135170","True","1","1","0","Business & Finance","Corporations","Corporations","how does off shore companies work...and how exactly do they laundry money?","","There are 10 million misconceptions about offshore companies. Most of those misconceptions come from ""poisoning"" from TV shows, which always show only one part of the story. 

(1) Offshore company is no more than a company that is not established in your home country. If you lived in United Kingdom, and you are a shareholder of a Hong Kong company, then Hong Kong is an offshore jurisdictions to you and a Hong Kong company is an offshore company. For people come from Hong Kong, a US company is an offshore company. Strange enough, a US Virgin Islands company is also an offshore company for US people although US Virgin Islands is an US territory. 

(2) Offshore companies are not merely used for tax planning purpose. Most of those offshore companies are used for cost-reduction purposes and almost the same proportion of those offshore companies is used for assets planning purpose - e.g. shareholding. 

(3) Tax, is by far the most ""un-wanted"" cost, so a large proportion of those offshore companies are situated in tax-free or low-tax countries, e.g. BVI, Singapore. Some international business corporation will choose establish offshore companies in offshore jurisdictions as their regional headquarter, to save cost. For example, popular choices are Singapore and Hong Kong for Asia regional headquarter. 

(4) Some offshore companies are used for asset planning purposes, say, for holding an international fund, or for listing on a stock market purposes because those jurisdictions' companies law offers a less restrictive regulations in designing shareholding structures. Cayman Island Companies is a very good example as it is accepted by most international stock exchange, and that Cayman Islands company laws follows the good tradition of British Common Law and company laws. 

(5) Some offshore companies are used for the purpose holding company or companies which offers services or doing business in a specialized industry, e.g. banking, insurance fund, IT business because of their favorable law which encourage the establishment of companies in a particular type of industry. E.g. Isle of Man is a reputable center for insurance fund, Luxembourg is famous for having all international banks established a branch in this small country and over 80% of its populations are working in the banking industry.

(4) People do use offshore companies to laundry money. But it is not offshore companies, which can laundry money, one must use ""offshore banking account"" to do so. Not only offshore companies can have an offshore account, a UK company, a US company a Canadian company can have an offshore account, hide their ill-earned money from their countries' authorities. Thats laundry of money, but there is no relationship between an offshore companies and laundry of money. An analogy is that 99.99% of people buying knives to use for cutting something, but some , very small part of those knife-owner, will us the knife to cut people. However, we would not jump to conclusion that the sole purpose of buying knife is to kill people."

There are countries with laws that let you live there or do business there and you don't have to pay them any taxes.

If you don't want to pay taxes you just move your corporation to one of those countries and you no longer have to pay taxes to anybody.

You cannot move to an island if you are General Motors or Wal-Mart but if you are a financial company buying and selling shares you only need a notebook and you can do business from the beach.

Let's say you steal cars in Detroit and you now have $1,000,000.00 USD in cash under your matress and you want to buy a nice house for your grandmother.

You cannot just buy the house with cash.

You need to turn your black money into white money first.

You hire a special company to turn your $1,000,000.00 USD black money into $900,000.00 USD white money.

Now you can buy the house.

I hope this helps."

"686301","121012","True","1","1","0","Consumer Electronics","Music & Music Players","Music & Music Players","how can I transfer music cassettes to cds using my computer and a cassette player?","","You will need a cassette player (!), PC with a stereo input to soundcard, conversion software, CD writer.
Note: if you are using a laptop, you may need a USB external soundcard (mine has only a mono mic input  not good enough!)  you can get cheap, simple but effective ones (from Hong Kong) via ebay
You could get someone to do it for you, friends of mine at: http://www.cassette2cd.co.uk for one. There are plenty to choose from out on the web, this type of job is perfect for a 'virtual' studio.
The software is probably the thing you really want to know about.. you will find loads out there. Personally I use Magix Audio Cleaning Lab  primarily for lifting vinyl, but will take any analogue signal. It has loads of features including cleaning filters, effects and editing its cheap too and even comes with a stereo cable  try ebay. There are loads more, some even free downloads (audacity avaiable from download.com) listen to folks who have used the software then have a go.
Oh yeah, and Magix has automatic track recognition based on silence between tracks and auto-stop recording so you can go out for the day and it will stop at the end of your tape  really useful!! You will use up loads of hard-drive space, so dont try this if you are pushed for spaceYou may need to purge the huge files every so often (10MB per minute WAV files, 1MB per minute MP3). You could save some space recording directly into MP3 at the sacrifice of a little sound quality.
If it's backup you're after, then MP3s at 128kbps would give good quality, MP3 at 192kbps will apparently give you a recording quality which is virtually indistinguishable from CD (WAV files) - worth considering as you will be able to get a lot of tapes backed up onto a single CDROM. 
One last thing, there are copyright issues here - if they are your own (commercial) cassettes it's fine as long as you don't sell off the cassette and keep the digital version. Obviously if the music is you and your mates playing in the garage, then that's fine too!
Hope this helps"

Otherwise they lay flat underwater so ships can pass over them.  In pictures you will often seen some raised, some missing. (i.e under water.)  

The barrier is only needed when there is a high tide and a surge due to weather conditions is forecast.  This might be becuas ethe air pressure is low or the wind is pushing water from the North Sea into the Thames estuary (like a funnel) forcing abnormally high water.

Each of the sections has a curved surface and a flat surface, the flat part lays horizontal when not inuse, and the whole section sits in a curved trough.  It is pulled upright when needed.

A typical tide range is 6 metres, but this can vary (and was recently at a maximum for the last 10 years)  A surge maye be in the order of  half a metre.

Incidentally, the London docks play a part in regulatingthe water height. There are large pumps that can help move water into the docks in emergencies.  eg water coming down the Thames."

Depending on your situation you can check out local colleges, training organizations such as IIL or ESI, and online courses.

Once you have some concepts, you'll probably want to try and take on an assistant project manager role - whether formally or informally.  Or perhaps oversee a component of a larger project/program and then move into the project manager role when opportunities present themselves.

As you get more experience you might also want to look at getting a PM certification."

P = k T Bw, where P is the power generated internally in a Resistor, T is the temperature and Bw is the badwidth of the measuring system or amplifier. If the Resistor (a component) is modelled by a Thevenin equivalente circuit, i.e. a noise voltage generator with Vth and Rth (voltage source and its impedance) feeding a matched load impedance R = Rth, results in Maximum power transfer, giving: kTBw = Vth^2/(4Rth).

Does anyone have any suggestion or have faced the same thing in the past?","try to stop drinking littleby little. like im tryin to stop cracking my knuckles. i used to crack them lie evry 5mins. my mom yells at me when she hears me. so i try to limit it to every hour. and now i can do it only once a day."

Once you stop taking caffeine after a prolonged period, your blood pressure goes up for a while, which in turn causes you to have headaches. Depending on how you react to caffeine, they could last for a couple of hours, or five days. In order to deal with the headaches, keeping yourself hydrated helps, and if you've got a nasty headache, eat a banana."

it has some caffeine in it but not as much as coffee.

Whether you spent the time reading, or traveling, or taking community college classes, then you can package up what you learned during that period to describe it positively.  If you spent most of the time watching TV and doing not much, you might need to reach deeper.

I think regardless of how you spent your time, you probably learned *something* during your unemployed period.  Focus on that, and how it helped to shape and develop your current viewpoints.

I like to use WD40 spray.  Open wide and fix into a bench vice. Take a medium to fine file and sharpen the diagonal cutting surface by imitating the cutting angle and with a little pressure pull the file from the joint to the tip of trimmer.  Very important not to file the flat side.  You might want to wear gloves. Sharpen by repeating this filing motion from the inside joint to tip pulling file to you.  Remove from vice and rotate for the other blade.  Normally 3 to 4 times ought to do it, I don't know how dull your hedge trimmer is.  Remove from vice and carefully close the trimmer, a little more WD40 never hurts and keeps it from getting dirty and rusty. Tighten the nut if needed.  Test.  Repeat if still dull."

If you're just starting out I would contact a local brokerage firm. They can guide you on choices. BUT you will make the final choices and your money is at risk.

 A horse stance  i or any stance should be considered a temporary  position to be in  while fighting. If you lock yourself into a stance- you become a static target."

We do a chi exercise with our arms out to our sides while doing the horse stance. Learn to relax. For me, being relaxed and focused is the key.

As far as fighting applications are concerned, there might not be a direct benefit to holding a horse stance for a long period but the mental toughness, mental focus  and tolerance for pain from doing this exercise can greatly benefit a martial artist."

It must be done appropriately for the best results...

Feet square, knees bent
Hold the position without bouncing.
Hold the same position for a minimum of 1 min.  Longer if possible.
Then go to a lower position and hold that.

There are several who will tell you to forget it, but I have personally seen this improve my own vertical jump as well as countless students."

"662356","117154","True","1","0","0","Sports","Martial Arts","Martial Arts","how do I keep a good horsestance for a long time?","","start out by doing a much deeper or wider stance in your horse stance because it'll put more emphasis on the hips and thighs to strengthen them, which in turn will allow you to do a regular shoulder width or a little bit further (whichever you prefer or your instructor prefers) than shoulder width.

if you have to, do it while standing against a wall (for better support) to keep your back straight because that's the main key of doing it properly.

another way is trying a weight belt tied with a 5lb weight (for starters to get used to the weight and add more later) or water filled milk jugs for added weight and start out around a 2 min mark in the stance and hold it; and steadily bump up the time bar to 3, 4,5 min, etc. again the key is keeping your back straight through out the exercise, otherwise you'll end up getting hurt."

It can contain star anise, fennel, cloves, cinnamon, and Szechwan pepper. Some blends have ginger and cardamom added, and other times they are simply added into the recipes using the five spice powder. 

Five spice powder should be used in small amounts. Use it in marinades or as a rub for meat, poultry and fish, or add it to rice and vegetable dishes.  Here is a recipe (see source below) for five spice powder, and a recipe for chicken wings that uses the spice mix!

Five Spice Powder:
4 tablespoons Szechuan peppers (or you can substitute other peppercorns)
4 tablespoons whole cloves
4 tablespoons broken cinnamon sticks
4 tablespoons fennel seed
12 whole star anise

Grind each ingredient separately in a spice mill or mortar. Combine and mix well. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.

FIVE-SPICE CHICKEN WINGS

1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce
3 lb chicken wings (about 16)

Preheat broiler and oil rack of a broiler pan.

Stir together garlic, five-spice powder, salt, and soy sauce in a large bowl.

Cut off and discard tips from chicken wings with kitchen shears or a large heavy knife, then halve wings at joint. Pat dry and add to spice mixture, tossing to coat.

Arrange wings in 1 layer on broiler pan and broil 6 to 7 inches from heat, turning over once, until browned and cooked through, 16 to 20 minutes total.  Serves 4."

3 tbsp. butter or margarine
1 tsp. five spice powder
1/2 tsp. salt (optional if you want it salt free)
3 cups broken walnuts

After marinating, place the chicken in roasting pan, spooning about 2 tbsp. of the marinade over the pieces. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes to 1 hour until pieces are crisp and done inside. Baste every 20 minutes or so with the juices in the pan. Notes: You can also grill this. If you do, bring the marinade to a boil first before using it to baste it as it cooks on the grill.

Ingredients:
3 pound pork shoulder roast
1 1/2 tsp. five spice powder
1 tbsp. vegetable oil
1 cup apple juice
3 tbsp. cider vinegar or herb vinegar
2 tbsp. soy sauce 

Trim fat from the pork roast. Check to make sure the roast will fit in your crock pot. If not, you can trim it to fit and place the extra around it where it will fit, or save to make stock at a later date by freezing. Rub the roast with five-spice powder. In a large skillet brown roast on all sides in hot oil. Place roast in crock pot. Stir together apple juice, vinegar, and soy sauce in the pan you browned the roast in. Stir with any juices and scrape the pan for any browned bits. Pour all over the roast in the crock. Cover and cook on low setting for 10 to 12 hours or on high for 4 1/2 to 5 hours. If the juices in the crock are not too fatty you can make a gravy with the juices or place in a pan and reduce the juices to make a sauce. Serve with rice or noodles, sauted green beans and salad."

1) The Florsheim Wedge (i.e. - kick the ball away from trouble with your shoe)

2)  Never declare more than a triple bogey on a bad hole.  Your partners don't bother counting after a couple of hacks in the fairway.  Who's gonna jerk out and call you on a 7 or 8? 
""What did you have there Doug?"" 
""Umm - what was that... a par 4?""
""Yeah""
""I had a 7""

3) Can you say ""Mulligan""?

1.  Don't turn in lower scores. The lady  that did this admitted that would mess up her handicap and she wouldn't win anymore. 
2.  Play casually during play days when on non tournament days and post their causal  playing high play scores.

ew im so fat
i need to loose like 2-3 or 4 pounds-seriously","My first piece of advice is to not listen to any of the advice posted so far.  

You can easily lose 4 lbs in 2 weeks without feeling hungry or exercising yourself to death.

First thing to note is that you don't get to choose where fat burns from.  If you want your belly to look better, you can lose some fat and do some muscle toning and the combination should help.

In order to lose weight, you simply need to restrict your calories by about 500 a day.  To figure out this magic number, use this formula:
BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kilos) + (1.8 x height in cm) - (4.7 x age)

Now that youve got your BMR, youve got a good starting point for how your body (at your current weight) burns calories. Now its time to use that information and figure out how many calories you burn during a normal day. You know, when you crawl out of bed and actually do something. Take the BMR, and multiply it by the Activity Multiplier below that best describes your average day:

Activity Multiplier
Sedentary = 1.2 (little exercise, desk job)
Light Activity = 1.375 (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/wk)
Moderate Activity = 1.55 (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week)
Very Active = 1.725 (heavy exercise/sports 6-7 days/week)
Extreme Activity = 1.9 (heavy exercise/sports, physically demanding job)

Now that you have your magic number to MAINTAIN weight, subtract 500 and this number is how many calories you should consume.  Don't bother subtracting more then 500 or you get into an unhealthy habit.

Use www.fitday.com to track your calories and you'll be on your way. 

Good luck!"

I ended up changing the carpet in my bedroom. That helped the most.
I diligently wash my hands, touch little in public, no cashier's pens to sign my name. Leave public restrooms if I cant use tissue or my outer sleeve to open the door I use my pinkie finger.ANYTHING you touch in public should be treated as if contaminated with cold germs, whether shopping going to a restaurant etc.

A cough ""hangs"" in the air for 2 hours. If someone coughs in front of me in public and I have to walk through the same path, I dont breath for a few seconds. Elevators, everywhere just careful. Carry hand sterilizer gel if needed.
Change your pillow since you've had so many frequent bouts. Vacuum and dust regularly and dont touch your face or hair when doing so. Wash your hands and change your clothes after you dust. I quit eating or drinking after anyone in the family and dont allow anyone to eat or drink from my stuff.

I've done this and more and I havent had bouts of colds for a few years, instead of every 6-8 weeks. I know this will help, I surely hope so. So glad to share with you. Keep me informed on how you're doing. Best wishes."

The Staples and bookstores come in packages with instructions. You can also buy forms online with instructions and there is software available also.

Bankruptcy under the new rules, since October 17, 2005, is tricky, so you should really go to a bankruptcy lawyer who has some experience.

I take it, since you say you don't own any property, that you are a nudist who resides in a nudist colony, and never brush your teeth or take a bath or shower. Right! Clothes, toothbrushes, soap, towels, etc., are property. So is a car, a watch, jewelry, tools, furniture, appliances, bank accounts. If you don't claim the correct exemptions, you could lose it all to the trustee.

Whether the debt is all unsecured or secured or a mix may make a difference. Student loans and child support arrears can't be discharged except under special circumstances.

You have to meet the income test to file a Chapter 7 without a problem. If you make more than the median family income for your state and family size, you have to go though another budget analysis to see if you have to file a Chapter 13.

Still think you can do it on your own?"

You have to pay off the car then the bank will release the title and you can then sign the title over to the new owner. Obviously, the one selling th car won't give you the money until the title is transfered. So you will need someone with money to spare (i.e. a bank, really really good friends). Get the cash, pay off the loan, sell the car, get the cash, pay off the buddy or bank.

If you are selling it to someone who has a loan from another bank or the same bank, get the banks involve and there shouldn't be a problem. The banks will work things out. All you have to do is sign the paper work. There maybe a fee involved but that is it.

If you are selling a car to a dealer, it is similar to having two banks involve. The dealer will deal with the bank and all you have to do is sign paper work. There shouldn't be a fee involve but more then likely you will have to sell your car to the dealer and subsequently buy a new/used car from them.

That said, there are a couple of strategies to employ.

First, I would recommend getting out of the cage.  There are two doors to the cage--both of which are locked--and you start next to one.  The bad news is the big prison-guy lands right next to you and starts swinging immediately.  I would run to the other door diagonally from where you begin and use either your knife (to save ammo) or whatever shotgun you have (to be quick) and knock the padlock off the door.  The knife is also quieter and less likely to attract the attention of the prison guy (who can't see, he has to hear you).  The problem here is that the Ganados on the outside can hit you on the inside, even with the chain weapons they have, through the bars of the cage.  Using either method, you have to be right on top of the padlock to be quick and that exposes you to attacks from the outside.  If you have to shoot and run that's not a bad idea, especially if you're running low on herbs or first-aid spray.

Once the door is down and you're out, the hard part is almost over.  Using your weapon of choice (I'm partial to the Riot Gun) shoot all the Ganados in the head to make quick work of them.  One or two will ""parasite out"" on you, so be warned and don't stand too close.  The prison guy may also find his way out of the cage.  If he does, keep running around the cage to keep it between him and you until you've capped the other Ganados.

Once he's alone, I walk around quietly (so he can't find me) and use the rifle to snipe the critter on his back from a distance.  Be warned that other Ganados will drop into the middle of the cage every once in a while so don't stay in scope for too long.  The good news is that if you don't want the money, once you're out of the cage you can leave--just make sure you grab the treasure in the chest in the middle first.  There's also a flash grenade in one of the cabinets in the corner adjacent to doorway through which you enter the room, should you need it. 

If you take the time to lay down the pimp hand on the prison guy, make sure you go into the alcove where the painting is--you'll find Magnum ammo near the counter where you shot from.  Also take note of this area--as soon as you get Ashley back, return to this room and go back to the locked door outside near the fountain with the crows.  If you piggy-back with Ashley, you can get the Broken Butterfly which is one helluva weapon--and for free, no less.

If you have any questions or need help try gamewinners.com or gamefaqs.com or send me an email.  This is a really good game and well worth getting past this point--no worries, I got hung up here too.  Good luck!"

It has great potential but its vision, mission and philosophy are clear to only a few.The school board installed non-qualified relatives for board and operational functions. The school is in a building owned by a relative. Only part of the building is used by the school, the rest utilized as residence by the owner. With that, their daily and personal going-ons are visible and observable at the area used as a school. They also kept animals in the compound which at best should be in a farm. Relatives in place at the board and operational level don't function as expected. All this have been observed by staff and parents - the school's direct clients. They pointed these out and had hoped for a change in the last two or three years but it appears that changes if any are superficial or temporary.School operations have not been smooth.  Bottomline is the regular exodus of clients' children to other private schools.","There's not much you can do, probably.  Neoptism is a powerful force.

All you can do is document the failures of the relatives, and risk your job making your case to the person in charge.

(ii)g(x,y,z)=x+y+z/3
(iii)h(x,y,z)=Max(x,y,z)

which of the following is/are true ?

I. f(x,y,z)>g(x,y,z) if x,y,z>0

IV. If g(x,y,z)=0,then there can be a maximum of two numbers among x,y,z ...which are negative.

a. I and II
b. II
c. I and III
d. IV



Question: 

what is the value of x,y,z i should choose to test the above ? should i choose x=1,y=2,z=3 ?  or something else ?

whats the wise decision of choosing the valueof x,y,z to test the above ? becoz the result highly dependent upon x,y,z

thanks","I. is not true because if we take x=y=z=1, we get
   f(1,1,1)=1 > 2 and 2/3=g(1,1,1) which is a false  
   statement.  
II. IMHO it is also false because f and h are the same  
    functions f: R^3 -> R, h(x,y,z)=f(x,y,z)=max(x,y,z)
III. |i(x,y,z)|^2=j(x,y,z) would be true (because of the  
     absolute value) but the statement in III. is again 
     false because if you take eg. point (-1,0,0) you get
     (i(x,y,z))^2=(min(-1,0,0))^2=-1^2=1 but
     j(x,y,z)=min(x^2,y^2,z^2)=min(1,0,0)=0 which doesn't  
     equal 1.
IV.  if g(x,y,z)=0 then x+y+z/3=0. Of course, you can take 
     such two negative values for two numbers among x,y,z 
     that the equation holds. There can always be a 
     function of maximum t(x,y,z)=max(x,y,z) irrespective 
     of the fact that g=0 !
Qs:  to show that a equation doesn't hold you need to pick
     such a point (in this case in R^3 so (x,y,z)) that it 
     shows the contradiction. You just need to practice :)

The funtions below are defined for all real values of x,y,z.

(i)f(x,y,z)=maximum of(x,y,z)
(ii)g(x,y,z)=x+y+z/3
(iii)h(x,y,z)=Max(x,y,z)
(iv)i(x,y,z)=Min(x,y,z)
(v)j(x,y,z)=Min of(x^2,y^2,z^2)

which of the following is/are true ?

I. f(x,y,z)>g(x,y,z) if x,y,z>0
II.h(x,y,z)>f(x,y,z) if 0<x<1  and y,z<0

IV. If g(x,y,z)=0,then there can be a maximum of two numbers among x,y,z ...which are negative.

a. I and II
b. II
c. I and III
d. IV



Question: 

what is the value of x,y,z i should choose to test the above ? should i choose x=1,y=2,z=3 ?  or something else ?

whats the wise decision of choosing the valueof x,y,z to test the above ? becoz the result highly dependent upon x,y,z

thanks","III is definately not true.
Example: x = -4, y = -5, z = -1
min(x,y,z) = -5
(-5)^2 = 25
x^2 = 16
y^2 = 25
z^2 = 1
Min(x^2,y^2,z^2) = 1
(-5)^2 doesn't equal 1.

Now is there a typo in the definitions of the functions?  Because f and h are defined as the same thing.  They are both the max(x,y,z).
Also, could you clarify g?
Is it (x+y+z)/3 or x + y + (z/3)?"

thanks","for testing I choose z=y=x=whatever
this gives you f(x,x,x)=g(x,x,x), so it is false.
for II as it is h(x,y,z)=f(x,y,z), so check for a typo.
for III take x=0, z=0, y=-2
i(-1,-2,-3)=-3; i^2=9
j(x,y,z)=1
so it is false
for IV if g(x,y,z)=0 =>x+y+z=0
the statement is true.
Proof:
Assume they can all be negative.
(x<0, y<0, z<0) then x=-|x|, y=-|y|, z=-|z|
|x| is the modulus of x and is positive
x+y+z=-(|x|+|y|+|z|)=-(something positive)<0
but this is in opposition to x+y+z=0
so they can't be all negative.
So, a maximum of two of them can be negative. qed
IV is true
d is your answer

Depending on what you're trying to do, you're liable to get yourself in a whole lotta trouble.  Lying about something like a criminal record, and you may wind up in federal prison.

Add to all this, there is now electronic trail that shows you were considering it, should it ever get that far.  I don't recommend it."

If you have the product you can utilize it as the marketing ""gimmick"" and give enough of it away until you get product recognition. Marketing, commercials, ads etc will do this much more efficiently. You can also get companies to endorse the product by giving it them to try on their customers and then offer it as sales in the future.

Also you may stuff them with rice and meat by scooping out the seeds and interior structure and putting them into an oiled shallow baking pan lined with onion and herbs ... a little broth or soup stock ... bake in the oven for 20 -- 25 minutes until done  (cook the meat and rice first,  since tomatoes are soft and cook quickly)

First, identify the emotions you feel and the reasons why.

Talk to your friend/counselor/spiritual leader, identify all the various emotions you have about this, and figure out what would it take to resolve them.
I am not sure based on what you say whether you are religious and if so whether you are Muslim, Christian or other, but all religions do spiritual counseling.

 I can understand your confusion, but bringing in the answer from above, my brother is also suffering from a brain tumour and my grandfather died four years ago of the same thing. sickness came into the world through SIN, not an individual sin but corporate. many ppl ask why God allows such terrible things to happen, but to ask Him to get involved, as in fix it, is to ask Him to make a judgement. Is any of us ready for God to do this???? as the question states, only 8 ppl lived the last time.

He Murdered them! How can we justify that?","What were the conditions on earth in Noahs day? The badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time. And the earth came to be ruined in the sight of the true God and the earth became filled with violence.Genesis 6:5,11.

Hence, God determined to wipe wicked humans off the earth by bringing a global disaster. The Creator, as Landlord of the planet, was fully justified in doing so because of mankinds depravity.

However, God took note of the outstanding integrity of Noah and his family. He promised them safety during the coming cataclysm if they obeyed his instructions. (Genesis 6:13-21)  The Bible account says: Noah proceeded to do according to all that God had commanded him. He did just so.Genesis 6:22.

What will happen to young children at Armageddon?

The Bible does not directly answer that question, and we are not the judges. However, the Bible does show that God views the young children of true Christians as holy. (1Cor. 7:14) It also reveals that in times past when God destroyed the wicked he likewise destroyed their little ones. (Num. 16:27,32; Ezek. 9:6) God does not want anyone to be destroyed, so he is having a warning sounded now to benefit both parents and children. Would it not be wise for parents to pursue a course that would result in their children being looked on with favor by God both now and at Armageddon?


At 1Corinthians 7:14 the Bible shows that God can consider as holy the minor children of a Christian parent. Though they are young and not yet to the point of being personally responsible to God, their parent is trying to develop in them a love of God and of the way of righteousness. It seems clear that at the time of the destructive war of Armageddon God will preserve them on the basis of the family merit of the Christian parent, even though the children are not yet dedicated and baptized.

Parents who reject the good news of the Kingdom and who ignore the good principles and wonderful purposes of  God cannot expect their minor children to survive the execution of divine judgment. Until a child reaches the age where it can be held responsible for its actions, it is under family responsibility. Divine punishment or blessing that comes to its parents automatically falls upon it. This principle is seen at Ezekiel 9:6, where Gods command was to slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark.AS.

The unresponsible children of the people who perished in the flood were not preserved with Noah in the ark, but were destroyed with their wicked parents. The same was true with regard to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. If those cities had contained ten righteous persons they would have been spared. Certainly there were more than ten unresponsible children in them; nevertheless, God destroyed the two cities."

Plus no one has perished yet, not even Satan. You are thinking carnally. We only dwell in these flesh bodies. Death of the flesh is not death of entity that dwells there.

But there is the second death, death of your soul. This is what you want to avoid. Because it's more than non-existence. It's blotted out of the book of life. No more to be remembered. You never existed. Your loved ones, if they make it, will have no memory of you. God will wipe away all tears.

God never said how we are going to die, we just know that we are going to die, whether it be by a flood or a car accident, etc.

God allows evil on the earth, so we can have a choice, to choose Him or evil.  If it was just God, of course we would choose God, because there wouldn't be anything else on the menu.,So that's why there is evil on earth.

As far as Noah, the people that died in the flood were sinning like crazy, and God wanted to start off fresh with some good, righteous people.

Our comprehension as a man is limited only to what we see today and do not see the brilliant plan of the Master in the future.  Let us trust that God knows what is best for us although sometimes we just do not understand.

There are a number of products available, such as corticosteroid and lignocaine products from your pharmacy that can sooth the itching and pain, diminish the swelling and stop bleeding. These come in suppository form, as creams or lotions. Witch hazel on cotton wool, applied to the outer an-us can help with itching. Cold compresses and warm baths can also help relieve symptoms. Using stool softeners, eating a high fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluids to avoid constipation should also improve your discomfort.

A doctor recommended that I try taking the supplement GABA, and I have not had problems with anxiety since then. I have found that it makes me feel calmer and more in control without feeling stupid, sleepy, or drugged. I would strongly recommend that you give it a try.  I have since heard from other friends who have had similar problems, and some of their doctors have also recommended they try GABA.

You can find it at your local health food store, like a GNC, or you can also find it online at vitaminshoppe.com. It is not very expensive and is only about $11 per bottle of 90 tablets, which will last you through 3 months. 

Otherwise, you can use relaxation and visualization techniques to help you with anxiety.  You can try doing activities that you find relaxing when you are able, like taking a long bath.

Good luck."

My answer is to look within and quit looking for someone else to give your life direction...they are all wrong for you.  They are only right to themselves and you are only right for yourself.  

I think we should all quit trying to give our life over to other people...it is called YOUR LIFE for a reason.  You are on a journey to find that reason and no one knows your purpose but YOU and yet may people will claim to 'know' because they want that opportunity to control you.

It also says in the Bible   2 Timothy 3:16-17 explains that,  ""All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.""

            This passage plainly tells us the word of God is sufficient for meeting all our needs for instruction from God. Further Hebrews 4:12 says, ""For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."" God proclaims emphatically that His word is to be the ""discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Therefore God has given us the tool or the means to determine if our experiences are from Him or not. His word sets the absolute criteria God tells us to use. Further in Matthew 7:21-23, Jesus explained that many would come in His name preaching, casting out devils and doing many wonderful works when in fact they were actually workers of iniquity. This tells us that everything done in the Lord's name does not come from Him and warns us about those doing ""wonders.""

 In another passage:
I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your old men shall dream dreams, Your young men shall see visions. And also on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days. And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: Blood and fire and pillars of smoke.

 The Bible says: 'And it shall be in the last days,' God says, 'That I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all mankind; And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, And your young men shall see visions, And your old men shall dream dreams."" Acts 2:17"

The prophets of God include Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, John the Baptist.  They foretold of upcoming events and every single thing that they said would happen, did."

Jesus said, ""know them by their fruits"".  I think what he/He meant is to see what a given religious leader is actually doing or saying and figure out for yourself whether they're actually doing good in the world or whether they're preaching that people do bad things or, as is all too often the case, are really after money and power.  (I'm not saying I necessarily believe that Jesus is Divine, mind you, but I think he/He at the very least had some real good ideas and that this is one of them. :-) )

One item that might help is the Advanced Bonewits Cult Danger Evaluation Frame (or ABCDEF).[1]  It has a list of questions about any given religious organization you're considering joining and helps you decide whether or not that organization is really a dangerous cult.  It's worked real well for me.  Although the author, Isaac Bonewits identifies himself as a Neo-Pagan, this can work for any group and he's intended it for use by people of all religions."

MEDDLES IN WAR AND POLITICS: Across Asia and beyond, says the journal Asiaweek, power-hungry leaders are cynically manipulating peoples religious sentiments for their own needs. As a result, the journal warns: The world threatens to sink into madness. A prominent religious leader in the United States declared: Youve got to kill the terrorists before the killing stops. His solution? Blow them all away in the name of the Lord. By contrast, the Bible says: If anyone makes the statement: I love God, and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. (1 John 4:20) Jesus even said: Continue to love your enemies. (Matthew 5:44) How many religions can you think of whose members engage in war?

SPREADS FALSE DOCTRINE: Most religions teach that the soul or spirit is some invisible part of a human that survives the death of the physical body. By means of this teaching, many of these religions exploit their members, charging money to pray for departed souls. However, the Bible teaches a different doctrine. The soul that is sinningit itself will die. (Ezekiel 18:4) The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Jesus taught that the dead will be resurrectedan unnecessary action if humans had an immortal soul. (John 11:11-25) Does your religion teach that the soul does not die?

TOLERATES IMMORAL SEX: In Western lands, church groups ordain gay and lesbian members of the clergy and urge governments to recognize same-sex marriages. Even churches that condemn immorality have tolerated religious leaders who have sexually abused children. What, though, does the Bible teach? It plainly states: Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men . . . will inherit Gods kingdom. (1 Corinthians 6:9, 10) Do you know of religions that condone immoral sex?

What does the future hold for religions that produce rotten fruit? Jesus warned: Every tree not producing fine fruit gets cut down and thrown into the fire. (Matthew 7:19) Yes, false religion will be chopped down and destroyed! But how and when will this happen? A prophetic vision recorded in the Bible book of Revelation, chapters 17 and 18, provides the answer.
False religion exerts influence over the kings of the earth

 
Get out of her, my people
How will false religion end?
Picture the scene. A harlot is sitting on the back of a fearsome beast. The beast has seven heads and ten horns. (Revelation 17:1-4) Whom does the harlot represent? She exerts influence over the kings of the earth. She dresses in purple, uses incense, and is exceedingly wealthy. In addition, by means of her spiritistic practice, all the nations are misled. (Revelation 17:18; 18:12, 13, 23) The Bible helps us to see that this harlot is a worldwide religious entity. She depicts, not any one religion, but all religions that produce rotten fruit.

The beast that the harlot rides pictures the worlds political powers.* (Revelation 17:10-13) False religion straddles the back of this political beast, attempting to influence its decisions and to control its direction.

Soon, though, an amazing event will take place. The ten horns that you saw, and the wild beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire. (Revelation 17:16) In a sudden, shocking move, the worlds political powers will turn on false religion and completely destroy her! What will prompt this action? The Bible book of Revelation answers: God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought. (Revelation 17:17) Yes, God will call false religion to account for all the despicable acts she has committed in his name. In a stroke of perfect justice, he will use her politi"

De 13:1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,
De 13:2 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;
De 13:3 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
De 13:4 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.

If he is not preaching the truth then he is not a prophet of God.  

And if some says something that could happen that isn't against the truth then only time will tell. 

De 18:20 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.
De 18:21 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?
De 18:22 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

If what he says is going to happen doesn't then don't worry he is not one.
To find out if we should listen to the people listed,  Look and see if they preach the truth according to the Bible and if they have said some thing and it hasn't happened then they are not right.  Paul would be the only good one up there top listen to.  I would say.  the rest of them twist the word of God and want your money."

If a prophet does not acknowledge Jesus, that person is not from God.  Such a person has the spirit of the Antichrist.

I think that you should listen to all people (or all things) that you believe to be important, inspiring, helpful, or good. To the others, you should be open to them and their ideas.

Who's a prophet? I could give you my own opinion, but whatever.

That's religious. I think the definition is anyone to whom god has spoken.

Just to quote Watchman (see above):
the Bible says: 'If anyone makes the statement: I love God, and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar.' (1 John 4:20)

Yeah, so, that makes all terrorists liars right?
So, the terrorists said that it's ok to kill people, right?
And the muslim terrorists all said that they were following the ""correct"" Islam, the way it should be.
They also said that everyone but them is wrong.

Try out for community theatre productions to start with, sinc ethe talent pool is smaller, and if you have no experience, it's a good place to start. Also, look for acting classes in your area. Go to a library and look for internships/apprenticeships in theatre, where you can go and learn all aspects of theatre, both the acting, and the technical (knowledge makes you a better actor, and helps give you skills which are employable during times you aren't acting. Programs like that can be wonderful springboards into the professional ranks. Study as much as you can, but also ACT as much as you can. On the job training is the most useful. You can learn something from everyone you encounter or work with, even if it's just learning what NOT to do. Take it from a guy who's been acting for the last ten years, and supporting himself completely through acting for the last three. Also, DON'T get trapped into thinking the only places in this country to move to are either LA or NY. Remember EVERYBODY out there is an actor, and NY is a complete wastye of time and money unless you belong to Equity, the theatrical Actor's Union. LA is roughly the same unles you belong to AFTRA/SAG, the TV and Film union. Other regions in the country can give you great experience to help build your resume before you try to make a leap into a big pond like NY or LA. Chicago is in my opinion the best city to be in because they have avital theatre and film/commercial market, and it's far less crazed than either NY or LA, and both of THOSE markets respect Chicago actors a great deal. But regardless of where you are, you shouldbe able to find some alternative to LA or NY until you are truly ready. Good luck."

They did a study w/ New Zelanders.  Why were they consuming fatty butter and steaks, and so thin and their body weight so low?  Why?? Because they feed their cows and animals on natural grass!  We don't.

It's also a cancer fighter .. it takes the unwanted fat out of your body where the cancer can hide.

Brush the back down and to the sides while blow drying.  After hair is dry, you'll use a strong hair wax to create the 'piecey' look, by rubbing the wax on your fingers, then applying the wax starting at the root, and pulling straight down to the tips, in whatever sized sections of hair you would like.  You may want to repeat this last part if necessary, depending on how piecey you want the look to be, and how effective the wax is.  Luck!"

I can't get a clean damn shave?","","The closest shave you can possibly get is with a depilatory.  These are chemicals that eat away hair at the root.  There are a few brands on the market for men.  ""Magic"" is the only brand name that springs to mind.  If you can't find it, try a barbershop or hair salon in a black neighborhood.  Many black men develop ugly, irritated bumps on their skin when they use a razor, and facial depilatories are more heavily marketed in black communities.

If that doesn't suit you, find an old-school barber who still knows how to handle a straight razor.  It's a little unnerving at first, but most guys who've had a professional shave find it to be a very relaxing experience."

By sharing their feelings, you might be able to determine what factors led the group participants to become distressed (if that's the case) from their stress-full lives.  When the group explains what factors led to their feelings of stress or distress, you could encourage the group to propose solutions on how they would have handled the situation differently.  This way, you have the group dynamic contributing solutions to one another without having advice come from the ""top on down"", if you know what I mean.  Hope that helps - good luck."
"140235","36218","True","1","1","0","Social Science","Psychology","Psychology","how to do group psychotherapy: stress?","i am running a psychotherapy group and was looking for ideas for sessions","Here are two ideas:
The exquisite cadaver:  This is really a literary excercise, but it helps group dynamics for its projection capabilities.  The dinamic is like this:  You give an idea for the beginning of a story (For example:  Mary went into the movie theather where she was supposed to meet her biological father ) and people around the table take it from there ( for example:  When she is standing in the line to buy popcorn, she notices that a very suspicious looking guy is entering the women bathroom )... everyone around the table takes the story from the point where someone else left it... each one writes their own contribution to the plot.

Idea 2:  Show the role playing games, like Dungeons & Dragons, but use simplified sets of rules so they can learn them fast and start playing right away.  In role playing, characters are developed according to special features such as abilities, racial special abilities and classes (professions).  It is really enlightning to see what features a set of players choose, and the playfull fantastic environment helps them to feel comfortable.  Its like a psychodrama, only lighter.  You dont go for the catarsis right away.  Instead, you let them toy with ideas and express themselves."
"140236","36218","True","1","0","0","Social Science","Psychology","Psychology","how to do group psychotherapy: stress?","i am running a psychotherapy group and was looking for ideas for sessions","I once ran a group session about taking care of yourself physically as a way to prevent stress, and that went over well.  I had some basic topics like sleeping, eating, exercises, hygiene.  I asked things like, who doesn't get enough sleep?  How does it make you feel?  How does that impact your life? Etc.  It seemed like the group members had an easier time talking about physical stuff than emotional stuff, and shared a lot of good ideas about improving these habits.

You might also present the problem-solving approach.  The basic steps are:  1.  Calm down.  2.  Identify the problem.  3.  Brain storm solutions (coming up with as many possible solutions, even outrageous ones, without judging them) 4. Rate each solution  5. Implement the best solution 6. Decide how things went - if the problem was solved or not 7. Implement another solution if possible or necessary 8. Take a break and forget about the problem for awhile.  You can do steps 2 through 4 in class.  You can ask for a group member to volunteer a problem that they would like solved (and that is appropriate to share with the group) and have the group come up with as many different solutions as possible.  At this point it is important to remind the group members that they are not judging the solutions, just putting them out there, and the facilitator may want to put out a few ""outrageous"" responses to get the creative juices flowing.  Then, as a group, you can go through the solutions and give each a 1 to 10 rating.  It helps if you have chalkboard or large poster board to write everything down on.  This can also take more than one session, as you can ask the group members to think of problems to bring to the next group.

I hope this helps.  You may have already had sessions like these."

If I have to go somewhere or shut her out of a room for a bit, she wants to start chewing on things.","Use lots of toys and try to re-enforce the proper chewing behavior by replacing the item the pup is trying to chew on with a toy. The pup needs to know it's okay to chew just not on ""this"" stuff. Crating is a good idea for short periods of time. Puppies shouldn't be left in a crate for long periods of time, unless you want them to pee and poop on themselves. Which makes house breaking a pup by means of crate very difficult. If you don't have a kennel for your pup, get one. Dogs need a place to be able to chill. My dog tore up everything until I got him a dog house. Pet stores also have a bitter apple spray that you can use on stuff that you don't want chewed on. Vinegar and cyan pepper are some home remedies for this also."

Get them some good rubber chew toys something not real big like maybe a rubber monkey or newspaper!
Do not punish them because they are only doing what feels good to them!
If you will provide them with plenty of their own toys you should be ok!"

She should be crated when you leave home and let out when you return. Gradually, increase her area. We got a baby gate and confined our dog only to the kitchen. We left lots of chew toys around. Then as he got older we were able to let him have the roam of the house. Your dogs is still a puppy and she doesn't want you to leave because she gets bored. Eventually, she will get through this stage-mine did! Good luck!"

Also of course you must keep a very clean record - no tickets or violations. As time goes on the premiums will automaticaly go down each year if you keep a clean record."

Also if it is cold you may want to put a heating pad under some hay on the floor. Also if it ever rains put in new hay and be sure to check for mold and bugs. There may also be ants or some other bug in it that he dosen't like. So check for all of these things. Good Luck! (this should apply even if it is the same dog house and if you don't want to buy hay soft towels and blankets that smell like you or your old house work too)"

How do I import the tape to my computer?","You need software.... I use Magix Audio Cleaning Lab for preference. You can get 'Audacity' for free from download.com. Some folks say you can use MS sound recorder - don't listen to them... it's really not built for this sort of task.
For help and advice, visit http://www.cassette2cd.co.uk/DIY/how_to.htm
the software help is on the following page: http://www.cassette2cd.co.uk/DIY/how_step_two.htm
I'm assuming that you can hear the sound via your PC speakers, if not go back to the first page of this section of the website.
Once your recording is imported into Audacity, you can edit the recording and save it as a WAV file - burn the WAV file to a CD. Magix has it's own CD burner, but with Audacity you have to do the burning as a separate task with your CD burning software.
You can get automatic track recognition on Magix software, but I haven't used Audacity enough to know exactly how to separate the tracks. Play around with it - it's got to be worth a try... If you have any problems, then look around for a cheap version of Magix Audio Cleaning lab, I got my 2004 edition cheap as it has been superceded, try ebay for out-of-date, but perfectly good versions....
Hope this helps, you can email for help from the cassette2cd.co.uk website if you need further information - it's all free..."
