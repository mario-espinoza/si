This directory contains test data for the Snowball stemming algorithms which
Xapian uses.  If Snowball has test data for a language, we include it here.
Sometimes we supplement Snowball's data with our own (or provide test data when
Snowball doesn't provide any).

There are two files which are from Snowball for each language (if Snowball
has no test data these are empty):

 <language>/voc.txt     -- A list of words, one per line.
 <language>/output.txt  -- The result of stemming each word.

Optionally, supplemental data is in these two files (if there is no
supplemental data, these files aren't present):

 <language>/voc2.txt    -- A list of words, one per line.
 <language>/output2.txt -- The result of stemming each word.
